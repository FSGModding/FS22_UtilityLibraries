## Included

### fs22Logger

A simple to use logging class that makes dumping strings and variables to the log file and
console much simpler.

Supports searching, filtering, and multiple run levels so you don't have to remove your logging
code to release a mod.

[More Information...](README_Logger.md)

TODO:

- Add :printVariableOnce()
- Add :printVariableIfChanged()

### fs22ModPrefSaver

This is a module to make saving and loading user preferences to disk as simple as possible. Supports
default values, and `string`, `float`, `integer`, `boolean`, and color table values.

[More Information...](README_ModPrefSaver.md)
